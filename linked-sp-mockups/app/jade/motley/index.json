The actors' names on the designs do not match the cast list of the original production because they were inserted on the designs later, in pencil, and indicate a later cast. Notes on some of the designs are in French, perhaps added during the Lyons production, \"Soldat Inconnu\". Some costumes are dated \"Motley 72\", and may have been new renderings prepared specifically for a later production.; See also 3 CRs under 730111 and the same title. These three designs (Wife, Arab and Barbarian) belong to this batch, two of them being dated \"Motley 68\""
